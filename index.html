                                As part of the Year 10 programme, students will be participating in four days of Education Outside the Classroom (EOTC). The focus of this programme is one of citizenship and social awareness.
                                <br><br>
                                The four days of activities in which your child will participate are as follows: Wainuiomata Camp (two days), Adrenalin Forest/Te Rauparaha Arena Aquatic Centre and Community Service. Students are expected to bring a packed lunch on all of these days, as they will not have any opportunities to purchase lunch.
                                <br><br>

                                These trips will run from Monday 8th December to Thursday 11th December. The cost for these four days is $90. This includes all trains, buses and coach transport, entrance to Adrenalin Forest and the pools, hire of Camp Wainui, dinner and breakfast and other miscellaneous equipment hire for activities. Students will always be able to attend the days. If money is an issue I can contact you to discuss it. Payment plans can be set up with the office.

                                A reminder that for some, these activities will be out of their comfort zone or they just 'don't want to do it', but this is not a reason to avoid the week. Resilience and perseverance, rather than avoidance, is a great life lesson that can be taught in the outdoors. If your child is hesitant, please still complete the permission form now and I can work with you both to ensure they can still participate where possible. I would love to have open communication with you if you have any concerns so please don't hesitate to get in touch.

                                It is essential that all students on the trip play their part in risk management. Their personal safety is very much their responsibility and they must always act in a manner that does not endanger either themselves or others. It is important that they follow the instructions of staff at all times.
